# Amazon Clone Project

## Project Overview
This repository contains the code for a weekly project where we developed an Amazon clone using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project aimed to simulate the functionality of an e-commerce website while practicing front-end and API integration skills.

## Features
- **Dynamic Product Display**: The site fetches product data from an API to display on the webpage.
- **Responsive Design**: Designed to ensure a user-friendly experience across various screen sizes.
- **Breakpoints Integration**: Leveraged breakpoints provided by the exercise to enhance responsiveness and layout adaptation.
- **Interactive UI**: Added interactivity with JavaScript for a seamless browsing experience.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- API Integration

## API Integration
We integrated an API (provided as part of the exercise) to dynamically fetch and display products on the site. The API endpoints were utilized to demonstrate practical usage of the `fetch` method in JavaScript for handling asynchronous data.
